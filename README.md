# ReVoShop

ReVoShop is a simple e-commerce website built using Next.js App Router.

This website is SPA-like (Single Page Application). It’s feels like single page application but it’s not totally like that. That’s make SPA-like is navigation use next/link, move page without full reload ,UX feels like one page. But it’s not totally SPA because we’ve so much route (/products/products[id]), there’s SSR & SSG , pages render in server. It’contain product list that we take from FakeStore API because to fulfill assignment RevoU in nextJS modul on week 13. So, I hope I can improve this project more if my knowledge grow more over time.

When user click one of product in list page, URL will change to be like /products/3, The number 3 here is ID product and then Next.js automatically read URL part and save it as parameter(params.id). Here’s a little picture about params work cycle :

In page.tsx especially on (const product = await getProduct(params.id) , params.id automatically filled by Next.js , the value comes from URL
